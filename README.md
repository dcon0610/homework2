# homework2

This project consisted of three pages: about, contact and portfolio pages. As I progress through the course, this page will be modified to be more appealing and also to contain projects and assignments which are relevant to my course. 

I began by creating the Navbar, which I then copied across to all three pages. The same was done for the header and the footer except modifying the contents of the header to suit the page. On each page, I used bootstrap classes to have a centralised div which filled up the centre of the page on all devices. 

Screenshots of each page are located in the assets folder:
